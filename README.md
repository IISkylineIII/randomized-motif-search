Randomized Motif Search
This repository provides a Python implementation of the Randomized Motif Search algorithm, a probabilistic method for finding motifs (recurring nucleotide sequences) in a collection of DNA strings.

This algorithm is commonly used in bioinformatics to identify conserved motifs, such as binding sites, across multiple DNA sequences.

Overview
The script uses a randomized approach to generate initial motifs.

It iteratively improves the motifs by generating a profile matrix with pseudocounts.

The algorithm terminates when no further improvement in motif score is found.

Repeats the process multiple times (default: 10,000 iterations) to increase the chance of finding a good solution.

How It Works
Randomly selects motifs from the input DNA strings.

Calculates a profile matrix with pseudocounts from current motifs.

Selects the most probable k-mer in each DNA string using the profile.

Repeats steps 2â€“3 until the score (distance from consensus) no longer improves.

Keeps the best motif set found across all iterations.

Functions
RandomizedMotifSearch(Dna, k, t, iterations): Main function that returns the best motifs found.

RandomMotifs(Dna, k): Generates all k-mers from each DNA string.

ProfileWithPseudocounts(motifs): Builds a profile matrix with Laplace smoothing.

Motifs(profile, Dna): Selects the most probable k-mer based on the profile.

Score(motifs): Calculates total mismatch score against consensus.

Consensus(motifs): Builds a consensus string from the motifs.

Count(motifs): Constructs a count matrix of nucleotides.

Example

k = 8
t = 5
Dna = [
    "CGCCCCTCTCGGGGGTGTTCAGTAAACGGCCA",
    "GGGCGAGGTATGTGTAAGTGCCAAGGTGCCAG",
    "TAGTACCGAGACCGAAAGAAGTATACAGGCGT",
    "TAGATCAAGTTTCAGGTGCACGTCGGTGAACC",
    "AATCCACCAGCTCCACGTGCAATGTTGGCCTA"
]

BestMotifs = RandomizedMotifSearch(Dna, k, t)

for motif in BestMotifs:
    print(motif)
Output
Each line of output represents a motif (substring) of length k, one for each DNA string:

CGGGGGTG
GGGCGAGG
GAAAGAAG
GGTGCACG
AATGTTGG

Requirements
Python 3.x
