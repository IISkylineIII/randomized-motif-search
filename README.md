# Randomized Motif Search Algorithm

This is a Python implementation of the **Randomized Motif Search** algorithm, which is used for discovering motifs in DNA sequences. The algorithm attempts to find a set of DNA subsequences that are statistically significant and can be used to identify conserved patterns across multiple DNA sequences.

## Installation

To run this algorithm, you need to have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. It is recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.

### Dependencies
You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
